# getSDO

A Python script to download the latest image from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory RSS feed.

I use it to set the screensaver image source on my Mac.

Based on [BigPicture.py](https://gist.github.com/prehensile/675906) by Henry Cooke and initially developed as a basic forked [gist](https://gist.github.com/mint5auce/ec6e81b2bcb30b617c80), since [moved](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13671328/transfer-gist-repo-to-github) to full repo for further development.

Requires: [Universal Feed Parser](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)
